Things I learned doing this project:



**Encountered a few CSS styles that were just not working - To solve this, I had to go back to the basics of understanding the "Cascading" part of CSS.**
   
The issue with my code was that in a *div*, I had multiple *buttons* -> for which I wanted to set different style properties. 

I was focusing on *button* - which ended up changing all the buttons on the page, due to the lack of specificity. 

To solve this, I created classes for each button.




**Display properties --> Inline, Block, Flex, and Inline-Block**
   
Inline -> Setting the property inline means you want to display visual elements in the same line.

Block->This means the HTML element will take a whole block space, start, and end with a new line. 

Flex-> Displays HTML element in a block-level flex container format.

Inline-flex->Displays HTML element in an inline-level flex container format

Inline-block->Elements are formatted as inline. However, you can apply height and weight to it.




**Layout**
   
Flexbox -> Here we lay HTML elements in a row or column format. 

Grid-> Here we lay HTML elements in a row and column format.

**Responsive-ness**
   
I intentionally wanted to create a responsive webpage, with pure HTML and CSS--to have a better ground level and foundation knowledge about it.

I made sure each and every div element containing the HTML elements is responsive using @media queries.

I used @media screen and (max-width: 600px) --> This means once the screen reaches 600px and lower the code inside it will run.

This was a fun activity, as I had to figure out which elements I had left out and also how to apply the same CSS property values to different elements' selectors.
